This Issue Template is based on the practices described in NHS Digital DCB0129/DCB0160 Clinical Safety Officer training.

### Description
A general description of the Hazard. Keep it short. Detail goes below.

### Cause
The upstream system Cause (can be multiple - use a numbered list) that results in the change to intended care.

### Effect
The change in the intended care pathway resulting from the Cause.

### Hazard
The *potential* for Harm to occur, even if it does not.

### Harm
An actual occurrence of a Hazard in the patient or clinical context. This is what we are assessing the **Severity** and **Likelihood** of.

### Possible Causes
An analysis of the Causes of the Hazard

-----
**Assignment**: Assign this Hazard to its Owner. Default owner is the Clinical Safety Officer @pacharanero
**Labelling**: Add labels according to Severity. Likelihood and Risk Level 
**Project**: Add to the Project 'Clinical Risk Management'

* Subsequent discussion can be used to mitigate the Hazard, reducing the likelihood (or less commonly reducing the severity) of the Harm.
* If Harm is reduced then you can change the labels to reflect this and reclassify the Risk Score.
* Issues can be linked to: Issues describing specific software changes, Pull Requests or Commits fixing Issues, external links, and much more supporting documentation. Aim for a comprehensive, well-evidenced, public and open discussion on risk and safety.
