# Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC)

!!! note "DTAC Assessment Document"
    This DTAC assessment is based on the template downloaded from the [NHS England Transformation Directorate website](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-technology-assessment-criteria-dtac/).

    As part of our effort to use modern web standards and publish documents more openly, we have converted the `.odt` original document into a native web page in our documentation site.

-----

## DTAC Document

The assessment criteria is made up of five core components. Sections A and B will provide the assessors the context
required to understand your product and support your evidence. The core assessment criteria is defined in section C1-C4.
Section D details the key Usability and Accessibility principles required. Further frequently asked questions
are available at the end of the document.

The core criteria in Section C will determine the overall success of the assessment of your product or service. The
accompanying score provided from Section D will show the level of adherence to the NHS Service
Standard.

## Section A. Company information
Non-assessed section

## Section C. Technical questions
Assessed sections

### C1 - Clinical safety

Establishing that your product is clinically safe to use.

You must provide responses and documentation relating to the specific technology product that is subject to assessment.

The DCB0129 standard applies to organisations that are responsible for the development and maintenance of health IT systems. A health IT system is defined as “product used to provide electronic information for health
and social care purposes”. DTAC is designed as the assessment criteria for digital health technologies and C1 Clinical Safety Criteria is intended to be applied to all assessments. If a developer considers that
the C1 Clinical Safety is not applicable to the product being assessed, rationale must be submitted exceptionally detailing why DCB0129 does not apply.

The DCB0160 standard applies to the organisation in which the health IT is deployed or used. It is a requirement of the standard (2.5.1) that in the procurement of health IT systems the organisation must ensure that
the manufacturer and health IT system complies with DCB0129. The organisation must do so in accordance with the requirements and obligations set out in the DCB0160 standard. This includes personnel having the knowledge, experience and competences appropriate to undertaking the clinical risk management tasks assigned to them and organisations should ensure that this is the case when assessing this section of the DTAC.

If the Clinical Safety Officer or any other individual has concerns relating to safety of a medical device including software and apps, this should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting system:

[Report a problem with a medicine or medical device - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)](https://www.gov.uk/report-problem-medicine-medical-device).

### C4 - Interoperability criteria

Establishing how well your product exchanges data with other systems.

To provide a seamless care journey, it is important that relevant technologies in the health and social care system are interoperable, in terms of hardware, software and the data contained within. For example, it is important that data from a patient's ambulatory blood glucose monitor can be downloaded onto an appropriate clinical system without being restricted to one type. Those technologies that need to interface within clinical record systems must also be interoperable. Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) should follow the Government Digital Services Open API Best Practices, be documented and freely available and third parties should have reasonable access in order to integrate technologies.

Good interoperability reduces expenditure, complexity and delivery times on local system integration projects by standardising technology and interface specifications and simplifying integration. It allows it to be replicated and scaled up and opens the market for innovation by defining the standards to develop upfront.

This section should be tailored to the specific use case of the product and the needs of the buyer however it should reflect the standards used within the NHS and social care and direction of travel. 

Please provide details relating to the specific technology and not generally to your organisation.

## Section D. Key principles for success

The core elements defined in this section will form part of the overall review of the product or service and is a key part to ensuring that the product or service is suitable for use. The assessment will set a compliance rating and where a product or developer is not compliant highlight areas that the organisation could improve on with regards to following the core principles.

This section will be scored in relation to the [<span class="underline">NHS service
  standard</span>](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard). This will not contribute to the overall Assessment Criteria as set out in Section C.

### D1 - Usability and accessibility
scored section

Establishing that your product has followed best practice.

Please note that not all sections of the NHS Service Standard are included where they are assessed elsewhere within DTAC, for example clinical safety.
