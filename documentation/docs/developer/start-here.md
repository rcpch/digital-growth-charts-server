# Getting Started Developing the Digital Growth Charts project

!!! warning
    **This section of the documentation is for people developing and extending the dCG API software tools - *not* for users or integrators of the Digital Growth Charts API.**

    **If you are an integrator and want to use the dGC API and other components to build growth charts into your digital health solution then go to [Integrators/Support](../integrator/support.md).**

If you would like to get involved in *developing* and *improving* the codebase of the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts API project, these and following pages detail some of the setup and working practices we are using.
