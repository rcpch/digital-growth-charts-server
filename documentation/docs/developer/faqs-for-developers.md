# FAQs for Developers

## Q: Where is all your dGC code?

**A**: The entirety of our Digital Growth Chart code is publicly available on GitHub, in the `rcpch` organisation. See <https://github.com/rcpch>.

## Q: Why did you build the API in Python?

**A**: Python has become the de facto language of the scientific and bioinformatics communities. Also:

- Most of the packages needed were '1st party' i.e. maintained by the PSF. Therefore, they have a level of reliability and provenance.
- It's a nice and easily readable language whilst being powerful enough for our requirements. Python has everything needed for building an API, demo sites, web platforms, etc.
- It's accessible to clinicians who want to learn to code; it's easy enough to learn, it's taught in schools!
