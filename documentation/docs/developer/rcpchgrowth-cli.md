# Developing the RCPCH CLI tools

Setup and installation of Python proceeds similar to the description in [Python setup](./api-python.md).

## Get the code

Git clone the repository to your development machine, and `cd` into it.

``` console
git clone https://github.com/rcpch/rcpchgrowth-python-cli.git
```

## Virtualenv

We recommend the use of Pyenv and a virtual environment. Any recent Python version should be fine.

```console
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.2 rcpchgrowth-python-cli
```

Using the same name `rcpchgrowth-python-cli` for your virtualenv will enable Pyenv to automatically select it when you navigate to the directory. This magic uses the `.python-version` *dotfile* in the project root.

## Locally install for testing

To test changes, install the development version of the library locally through

```console
pip install -e .
```

Now, any changes you make to the local code will immediately be reflected in the CLI tool.

## Versioning

We use a package called `bump2version` which is a maintained fork of the original, but abandoned, `bumpversion`.

You need to start with a clean commit status i.e. any new changes are committed in Git.

To update the version with a small patch change or fix, use:

``` console
bumpversion patch
```

For 'minor' version changes, use:

``` console
bumpversion minor
```

For 'major' version changes, use:

``` console
bumpversion major
```

Bump2version will update the version in `setup.py`, creating a new commit and tag.
