# Pricing and Commercial Information

The RCPCH is a registered charity, and the Digital Growth Charts API's cost model is designed to ensure sustainable future maintenance and development of the Digital Growth Charts APIs. We also have a commitment to always provide a Free Tier to ensure rapid on-boarding and novel and exploratory uses.

[:moneybag: The most up-to-date pricing and support information is on the RCPCH website](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/growth-charts/digital/about#subscriptions-and-pricing).

We have a range of options for API usage tiers and developer support, which we've developed to cater for a range of organisational sizes and requirements, however if you don't see what you need then please do [contact our Commercial team](../about/contact.md#commercial).
