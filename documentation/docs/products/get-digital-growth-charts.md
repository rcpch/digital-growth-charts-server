## Are paper growth charts holding up digital transformation?

We know from talking to experienced child health clinicians that they absolutely **must have** growth charts in any new digital solution. The lack of good quality and richly functional digital growth charts on the EPR/EHR market has held back digital transformation in many care settings. Some care-giving organisations have been forced to either hold up plans for digitisation, or use a parallel paper chart workflow.
