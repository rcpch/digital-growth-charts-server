This is a modern dGC client for mobile, written in React Native by Dr Charles van Lennep. React Native is a cross-platform native app development platform, which can run on Android or iOS.

A separate React Native codebase for mobile allows optimisation of the viewport for mobile device displays. It also allows touch-dependent features to work properly such as scrolling, zooming, and selecting tooltips to work.

It uses the same [React Chart Component Library](../products/react-component.md) code for its charting.

We hope to develop the React Native client into a clinical RCPCH-approved digital multi-tool, containing other calculations used every day in clinical practice, and backed by future APIs.
