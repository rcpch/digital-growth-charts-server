# Down and Turner Syndrome Charts

## Nomenclature

Where possible we have referred to Down Syndrome (as opposed to Down's Syndrome or Trisomy 21) and Turner Syndrome (as opposed to Turner's Syndrome or Monosomy X) in the charts and documentation. This is in line with the current medical literature and the preference of many patient groups.

## Down Syndrome charts

The PDF linked below was produced in 2012 to accompany the Down Syndrome charts. In due course, we will update and reformat the text and adapt the presentation for the API version of the charts.
