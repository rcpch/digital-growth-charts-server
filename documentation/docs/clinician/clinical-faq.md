# Clinical FAQ

The following are the original FAQs from previous (non-Digital) versions of RCPCH Growth Charts. We have included them in our dGC documentation to provide a comprehensive resource for clinicians, as most of the advice remains relevant.

### When should babies be weighed?

Babies should be weighed in the first week, as part of the assessment of feeding, and after as needed. Recovery of birthweight indicates that feeding is effective and the child is well. Once feeding is established, babies should usually be weighed at around 8, 12 and 16 weeks and 1 year at the time of routine immunisations.

Weights measured too close together may be misleading, but if there are concerns about [faltering growth](https://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/faltering-growth#content=view-node%3Anodes-monitoring), weight should be measured more often, but usually no more often than:

- daily if less than 1 month old.
- weekly between 1–6 months old.
- fortnightly between 6–12 months.
- monthly from 1 year of age.

### When should length or height be measured?

Length or height should be measured whenever there are any worries about a child’s weight gain, growth or general health. Measure length until age 2, measure height after age 2.  A child’s height is usually slightly less than their length.

### How should weight loss after birth be assessed?

Weight gain in the early days varies a lot from baby to baby, however, by 2 weeks of age most babies will be on a centile close to their birth centile. Most babies lose some weight in the first 3-4 days after birth, but most have regained birth weight by 3 weeks of age. Careful clinical assessment and evaluation of feeding technique is indicated when weight loss exceeds 10% or recovery of birth weight is slow.

Calculating the percentage weight loss is a useful way to identify babies who need assessment.
Percentage weight loss can be calculated as follows:

<div class="latex">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Percentage\;Weight\;loss = \frac{Birth\;weight - Current\;weight}{Birth\;weight} \times 100" />
</div>

For example, a child born at 3.500kg who drops to 3.150kg at 5 days has lost 350g or 10%; in a baby born at 3.000kg, a 300g loss is 10%.

### What is a normal rate of weight gain and growth?

Babies do not all grow at the same rate, so a baby’s weight often does not follow a particular centile line, especially in the first year. Weight is most likely to track within one centile space (the gap between two centile lines, see diagram). In infancy, acute illness can lead to sudden weight loss and a weight centile fall, but on recovery the child’s weight usually returns to its normal centile within 2–3 weeks. However, a sustained drop through 2 or more weight centile spaces is unusual (fewer than 2% of infants), and should be carefully assessed by the primary care team, including measuring length/height.

Because it is difficult to measure length and height accurately in pre-school children, successive measurements commonly show wide variation. If there are worries about growth, it is useful to measure occasionally over time; most healthy children will show a stable average position over time.

UK children have relatively large heads compared to the WHO standard, particularly after the age of 6 months. After the age of 6 weeks, a head circumference below the 2nd centile will be seen in only 1 in 250 children. A head circumference above the 99.6th centile, or crossing upwards through 2 centile spaces, should only cause concern if there is a continued rise after 6 months, or other signs or symptoms.

### Why do the length/height centiles change at 2 years?

The growth standards show length data up to 2 years of age, and height from age 2 onwards. When a child is measured standing up, the spine is squashed a little, so their height is slightly less than their length; the centile lines shift down slightly at age 2 to allow for this. It is important this difference does not worry parents; what matters is whether the child continues to follow the same centile after the transition.

### When is further assessment required in school aged children?

If any of the following occur:

- Where weight or height or BMI is below the 0.4th centile, unless already fully investigated at an earlier age.
- If the height centile is more than 3 centile spaces below the mid-parental centile.
- A drop in height centile position of more than 2 centile spaces, as long as measurement error has been excluded.
- Smaller centile falls or discrepancies between child’s and mid-parental centile, if seen in combination, or if associated with possible underlying disease.
- If there are any other concerns about the child’s growth.
