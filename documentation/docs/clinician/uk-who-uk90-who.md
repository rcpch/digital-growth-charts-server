# UK-WHO, UK90, and WHO charts

The UK-WHO 0-4 year old charts were officially launched on May 11th 2009. Any child born after that date should be plotted on a UK-WHO growth chart. Children born before May 11th 2009 are plotted on British 1990 (UK90) charts and subsequent measurements must be plotted using those charts. After age 4, the two charts are the same.

## UK-WHO Charts

The UK–WHO growth chart combines World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 standards with UK 1990 preterm and birth data.

- The chart for birth measurements (32 – 42 weeks gestation) is based on British children measured around 1990.
- The chart from 2 weeks to 4 years of age is based on the WHO growth standard, derived from measurements of healthy, non-deprived, breast-fed children of mothers who did not smoke.
- The UK 1990 growth reference for children is used from 4 years - 18 years.
- The charts depict a healthy pattern of growth that is desirable for all children, whether breast-fed or formula-fed, and of whichever ethnic origin.

### Reason for combining UK 1990 and WHO2006

Though the UK90 data spans 23 weeks gestation to 20 years old, it also includes children who were bottle-fed and breast-fed. Thus, the breast-fed cohort from the WHO2006 cohort were deemed more accurate and replaced the UK90 for the 2 week to 4 year age groups. As the UK90 data are no longer used for children in this age bracket, they have been omitted to create a continuous data set.

The final dataset has 4 parts:

  1. Pre-term (up to 42 weeks)
  2. Infants (under 2 years)
  3. WHO 2006 children (2 — 4 years)
  4. UK 1990 children (4 years — 18 years)

Where datasets overlap, there are 2 ages at the junction, one from each of UK90 and WHO 2006. There is a purposeful step at the junction between the data sets.


## Centile Terminology

![What are centiles](../_assets/_images/centile-terminology.png)

These charts indicate a child’s size compared with children of the same age and maturity who have shown optimum growth. The chart also shows how quickly a child is growing. The centile lines on the chart show the expected range of weights and heights (or lengths); each describes the number of children expected to be below that line (e.g. 50% below 50th, 91% below the 91st). Children come in all shapes and sizes, but 99 out of 100 children, who are growing optimally, will be between the two outer lines (0.4th and 99.6th centiles); half will lie between the 25th and 75th centile lines.

Being very small or very big can sometimes be associated with underlying illness. There is no single threshold below which a child’s weight or height is definitely abnormal, but only 4 per 1000 children who are growing optimally are below the 0.4th centile, so these children should be assessed at some point to exclude any problems. Those above the 99.6th centile for height are almost always healthy. The BMI should be calculated if weight and height centiles appear very different.

## Measuring children

Anyone who measures a child, plots or interprets charts should be suitably trained, or be supervised by someone qualified to do so. For further information and training materials, see the [RCPCH website](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/uk-who-growth-charts-guidance-health-professionals).

!!! tip "Clothing and nappies"
    - When measuring children **up to 2 years**, remove all clothes and nappy.
    - Children **older than 2 years** should wear minimal clothing only.
    - Always remove the child's shoes.

- Weight: use only Class III clinical electronic scales in metric setting.
- Length: (before 2 years of age): proper equipment is essential (length board or mat). Measurers should be trained.
- Height: (from 2 years): position head and feet as illustrated, with child standing as straight as possible. Measure height recorded to the last millimetre. A correctly installed stadiometer, or approved portable measuring device rigid rule with T piece, is the only equipment that can be reliably used.
- Head circumference: use a narrow plastic or paper tape to measure where the head circumference is greatest.



### How do SDS charts work?

Centiles are derived mathematically from standard deviation scores (SDS), also known as z scores. These values in turn are related to p values - the probability of finding a child with a given measurement in a sample. An SDS of 0 equates to the 50th centile, with positive values relating to centiles above this, and a negative value relating to centiles below. The benefit of reporting and charting SDS rather than centiles is that values can all be plotted on the same chart. It is important to note that plotting the z score against age must be against the *corrected* age, not the *chronological* one, as the chart otherwise becomes crowded and hard to interpret.


### Weight–height to BMI conversion chart

</div>

BMI indicates how heavy a child is relative to his or her height and is the simplest measure of thinness and fatness from the age of 2, when height can be measured fairly accurately.  In a child over 2 years of age, the BMI centile is a better indicator of overweight or underweight than the weight centile; a child whose weight is average for their height will have a BMI between the 25th and 75th centiles, whatever their height centile. BMI above the 91st centile suggests that the child is overweight; a child above the 98th centile is very overweight (clinically obese). BMI below the 2nd centile is unusual and may reflect under-nutrition.

### Percentage median BMI

The child or young person's BMI is compared with the median value for age and sex and expressed as a percentage. It is used mainly for risk assessment in eating disorders.

### Predicting adult height

Parents like to know how tall their child will be as an adult. The child’s most recent height centile (aged 2–4 years) gives a good idea of this for healthy children. Plot this centile on the adult height predictor to the right of the height chart to find the average adult height for children on this centile. Four out of five children will have adult heights that are within ± 6cm of this value.

#### Adult Height Predictor
The paper-based Adult Height Predictor allowed you to predict the child’s adult height based on their current height, but with a regression adjustment to allow for the tendency of very tall and short children to be less extreme in height as adults. Four girls out of five will have an adult height within ± 6cm of the predicted adult height.
