# Privacy Notice

## What information do we collect about you?

If you choose to create an account for the API service, we collect your name and email address and ask you to create a password. If you upgrade to a paid subscription, we will ask you for more details to process the payment.

We will process your data as part of a contract with you. Information collected will be used to create and manage your account, and to contact you about Growth API. We do not use your personal data to make automated decisions or undertake profiling about you.

It is important to distinguish between **the account data we collect about Integrators** (developer account data) and **the data we process on your behalf**. The data we collect about you is your account information, which is used to manage your account and contact you about the service. The data we process on your behalf is the measurements you send to the API, which are used to calculate centiles and SDS scores.

## What do we do with your developer account information?

We have stringent security measures in place to ensure your information is securely stored. Your information will not be shared outside the RCPCH. Information will be stored with third-party suppliers who are acting on our behalf as data processors to provide certain products and services for the College. Your personal data will not be transferred outside of the UK.

We will only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfil our contract with you. If you decide to end your subscription with us, we will retain your account details for two years after the end of your subscription and then delete your data.

## What do we do with the data you send to the API?

The RCPCH Digital Growth Chart API is **stateless**, meaning it does not persist **any** data about the measurements sent to it. This is a crucial part of the API’s privacy design and has enabled us to keep the API development simple and constrained to solving the specific problem of providing centile/SDS calculations as a service.

It is the responsibility of the *consuming application* to store the measurements. This is the logical place to store data about the child since this consuming application will already have other stored data about the child within it, such as demographics. The consuming application also already has an appropriate legal basis for storing the data, such as Direct Care.

## Your Rights

You have the following rights in relation to your data:

* Right of access and right to have a copy of your account data in a standard format (right to data portability).  You can ask us for a copy of the information that we hold about you. You can also ask us for a copy of your data in a standard format where this is technically possible. This only applies where we are holding your information with consent or as part of a contract with you.

* Change any factual errors or inaccuracies (right of rectification). If you have an RCPCH developer account you can change and update your personal data. It is your responsibility to update us with any changes to the personal information you have provided. You can also contact us either via our contact form or contact the relevant team directly.

* Delete your personal data (called a right to erasure). We cannot delete all personal data as we may have a legal obligation or because we have a requirement to retain it for a task in the public interest, but we can delete non-essential data.

* Restrict the use of your data (right of restriction). You can request that we deactivate your RCPCH developer account or that we only store your data but undertake no further processing. However, this only applies to certain circumstances.

* Object to processing (right to objection). You can ask that we stop using data that is not necessary for fulfilling our legal obligations.

## DataRep - Our EU Partner

    If you are located in the EEA or EU, you can contact DataRep if you wish to make a request under EU GDPR.

    As we sometimes process the personal data of individuals in the EU and EEA area, in either the role of ‘data controller’ or ‘data processor’, we have appointed DataRep as our Data Protection Representative in the European Union for the purposes of EU GDPR, so that you can contact them directly in your home country.

    If we have processed or are processing your personal data and you are located outside of the UK, you may be entitled to exercise your rights under EU GDPR in respect of that personal data. For more details on your rights in the EU, please refer to the European Commission or the national Data Protection Authority in your country.

    If you want to raise a question to RCPCH, or otherwise exercise your rights in respect of your personal data, you may do so by:

    Please note, when mailing inquiries, you must mark your letters for ‘DataRep’ and not ‘RCPCH’, or your inquiry will not reach them. Please refer clearly to RCPCH in your correspondence. On receiving your correspondence, RCPCH is likely to request evidence of your identity, to ensure your personal data and information connected with it is not provided to anyone other than you.

    If you have any concerns over how DataRep will handle the personal data they will require to undertake for their services, please refer to their privacy notice.
