!!! note "About the Data Security and Protection Toolkit"
    The Data Security and Protection Toolkit is an online self-assessment tool that allows organisations to measure their performance against the National Data Guardianâ€™s 10 data security standards.

    All organisations that have access to NHS patient data and systems must use this toolkit to provide assurance they are practising good data security and that personal information is handled correctly.
