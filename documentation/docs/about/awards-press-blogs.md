# Awards, Press, Blogs, and other Mentions of the dGC Project

## 2020 Health Tech Awards

**WINNER: “Best Health Tech Solution” Category**

Beginning the project at the pinnacle of the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic, we remotely collaborated to build the Digital Growth Charts project. We went on to win the 2020 Health Tech Award category for Best Health Tech Solution – against a strong field of established health tech companies and NHS trusts. It was heartening to see infrastructural projects like ours being recognised as the building blocks of incredible future clinical interfaces.
