## Technical and Clinical Enquiries

!!! info "Discourse Forum"

    For all technical and clinical enquiries, we encourage the use of our open forum. This develops a community resource of previously asked and answered questions.

    These are the basis of an open, searchable knowledge base about the dGC Platform.

!!! info "Signal Chat"

    We have an RCPCH Developers Signal chat group for instant message support of the RCPCH dGC project.

    We can't guarantee immediate response but our main developers see these messages and endeavour to respond as rapidly as possible. Join by using this button:
