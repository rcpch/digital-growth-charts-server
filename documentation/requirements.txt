# requirements for the dGC documentation

# **** MATERIAL FOR MKDOCS INSIDERS ****
# IMPORTANT: This project uses Material for MkDocs **Insiders** Edition.
# To install this you will need a GitHub token which is available (for RCPCH team only)
# from Marcus Baw (pacharanero).
# If you have the token, you can manually run this command to install Insiders:
# pip install git+https://<INSERT_GH_TOKEN_HERE>@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
# Further information is at https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/getting-started/
# In production/deployment, the relevant GitHub workflow has access to the token.

# **** MATERIAL FOR MKDOCS ****
# In a situation where you need to run the documentation site locally but can't
# get access to the GitHub token, you can uncomment the line below to access the normal version.
