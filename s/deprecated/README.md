# Deprecated scripts

These scripts were used for setting up and running the dGC server locally for development.

We have since moved to a Docker-based method of running the server locally. These scripts are no longer routinely used but they have been left here for information in case needed. Please bear in mind that they may at some future point cease to function properly as we make changes to the main program, because these scripts will not be updated.
