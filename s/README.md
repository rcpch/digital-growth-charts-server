This folder contains some simple scripts to help with development

To run them, ensure they are made executable in your filesystem (they may not be by default depending on your OS)
You can do that in whatever File > Permissions > Make Executable menu your desktop provides, or for *nix environments or the WSL you can type
`chmod +x <filename>` to add executable permissions.

## Start the API server with default settings

`$ s/start-server`
