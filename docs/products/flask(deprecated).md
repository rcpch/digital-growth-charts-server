# Flask/Python (deprecated)

In the first few weeks of the develoment of the growth charts, our client was simply part of the same Flask app which later became the API. At that point it was necessary to separate the two apps functionally in order for the client to use the API over REST.

All information about the now-deprecated Flask/Python demo client can be found at the repository link below.
