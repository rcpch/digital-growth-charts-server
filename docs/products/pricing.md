# Pricing and Commercial Information

The RCPCH is a registered charity, and the Digital Growth Charts API's cost model is designed to ensure sustainable future maintenance and development of the Digital Growth Charts APIs. We also have a commitment to always provide a Free Tier to ensure rapid on-boarding and novel and exploratory uses.

The most up-to-date pricing and support information is on the [RCPCH website](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/growth-charts/digital/about#subscriptions-and-pricing)

We have a range of options for API usage tiers and developer support, which we've developed to cater for a range of organisation sizes and requirements, however if you don't see what you need then please do [contact our Commercial team](../contact/contact.md#commercial).
