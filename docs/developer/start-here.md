# Getting Started Developing the Digital Growth Charts project

!!! tip
    This section of the documention is for people developing and extending the actual dCG API application itself - **not** for users or integrators of the dGC API.
    
    If you are an integrator and want to use the API and other  components then go [here](../integrator/getting-started.md).

If you would like to get involved in *developing* and *improving* the codebase of the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts API project, these pages detail some of the setup and working practices we are using.
